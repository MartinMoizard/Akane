A ComponentViewModel stores a Component-related business logic. 
As an example, a ComponentViewModel can implement networking logic, 
model instantiations, or simple algorithms.

It is intended to be bound on a `UIView` conforming to `ComponentView`.

Whenever a CompnentViewModel is displayed for the first time, the 
`willMount` function is called, in order to perform additional 
configuration.
